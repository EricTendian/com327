# Eric Tendian's Background and Ambitions
### COM 327, Fall 2014

## Background
Hi there! I'm Eric Tendian, a 2nd-year student majoring in Information Technology and Management at the Illinois Institute of Technology. This fall semester I'm taking the following classes:

- Advanced Engineering Graphics for Non Engineers - EG 325
- Principles of Economics - ECON 211
- Introduction to Data Networks and the Internet - ITMO 440
- IPRO 497-05 - Innovative Solutions to Urban Problems
- Standards-Based Web Design - COM 327
- Introduction to Open Source Operating Systems - ITMO 456

And I'm webmaster for the following organizations:

- IEEE (IIT Chapter)
- Commuter Student Association
- Net Impact (IIT-Stuart Chapter)

Previously, I attended Northside College Preparatory High School, a Chicago Public School, where I took lots of computer science courses and was on the swim team. I've lived in Chicago ever since I was 2 years old, after moving from Birmingham, Alabama, my birthplace.

Currently, my interests lie in the intersection between technology and each of the following: education, crime (and other urban problems), aviation, and communication. With a passion for web development, I have built an online flight simulator community, a course registration website, chatrooms and more.

Talking more technically about web development, most of the work I've done has been with a framework or CMS, tweaking existing code and adding the functionality I desire. PHP, JavaScript (Node.js), Java, C++, SQL, are languages I've "spoken" in. I have done some frontend work too, converting Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop files into HTML/CSS/JS.

Over the summer I worked on Packback's engineering team, utilizing my PHP skill to help rebuild the ecommerce platform. Now that classes have started again, I continue to work with them, fixing bugs on the site as well as adding new features. Learned a lot at that internship, so I will be writing a blog post on my experience in the coming days.

Besides the world of code, I listen to police scanners and tweet about crime/mayhem. You can find more about that on my Twitter feed, linked below.

## Ambitions

I've got a lot of ambitions.

For COM327 specifically, I'm eager to learn more about web standards and what the "proper" way of writing HTML/CSS/JS is, so I can apply that in my professional and personal work. Additionally, I have never done mobile-first design before, so I would like to go deeper into that. My primary reason for taking the class is to learn more on the design and standards side, as I already know the language syntax. Hopefully by the end of the semester my learning goals will be accomplished.

More broadly, this fall and spring semester my ambition is to participate more in class - ask questions, have longer discussions. Often I feel like I am not fully absorbing the knowledge because I do not have a chance to apply it or discuss it, so I want to change that. Additionally, I seek to do some teaching of my own. Over the summer I gained the nickname of "The Professor" for actually teaching the more experienced team members a couple things. I want to continue this trend of spreading my knowledge through sharing my experience in classes as well as meeting with people one-on-one.

In the next 3-5 years, my aspiration is to graduate IIT (hopefully in Spring 2016), and move on to join a startup company involved in education or aviation. Perhaps even launching my own company out of college - I already am working on Plannr, a new way to do academic planning and course registration, so I want to continue working on this and expand the business to at least 5 universities. This will take a great deal of work, especially for getting the initial university onboard with the software.

From a very early age, I have been tinkering with systems (electronic and otherwise). Throughout my life, I want to make sure the work I do is meaningful. Meaningful not just for myself, but for others who may not be as well-off. My professional and personal goal/mission is to help make people more informed & knowledgeable. I have done this through technology thus far, and I am content with continuing this trend. However, I may want to expand my horizons to outside technology - you can only do so much with ones and zeroes. How far will this mission take me? I can't wait to find out.
