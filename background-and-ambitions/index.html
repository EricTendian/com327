        Hi there! I'm Eric Tendian, a 2nd-year student majoring in Information
        Technology and Management at the Illinois Institute of Technology. This fall
        semester I'm taking the following classes:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>EG 325: Advanced Engineering Graphics for Non Engineers</li>
        <li>ECON 211: Principles of Economics</li>
        <li>ITMO 440: Introduction to Data Networks and the Internet</li>
        <li>IPRO 497-05: Innovative Solutions to Urban Problems</li>
        <li>COM 327: Standards-Based Web Design</li>
        <li>ITMO 456: Introduction to Open Source Operating Systems</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        And I'm webmaster for the following organizations:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>IEEE (IIT Chapter)</li>
        <li>Commuter Student Association</li>
        <li>Net Impact (IIT-Stuart Chapter)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Previously, I attended Northside College Preparatory High School, a Chicago
        Public School, where I took lots of computer science courses and was on the
        swim team.I've lived in Chicago ever since I was 2 years old, after moving
        from Birmingham, Alabama, my birthplace.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, my interests lie in the intersection between technology and each of
        the following: education, crime (and other urban problems), aviation, and
        communication. With a passion for web development, I have built an online
        flight simulator community, a course registration website, chatrooms and more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Talking more technically about web development, most of the work I've done has
        been with a framework or CMS, tweaking existing code and adding the
        functionality I desire. PHP, JavaScript (Node.js), Java, C++, SQL, are
        languages I've "spoken" in. I have done some frontend work too, converting
        Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop files into HTML/CSS/JS.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the summer I worked on Packback's engineering team, utilizing my PHP
        skill to help rebuild the ecommerce platform. Now that classes have started
        again, I continue to work with them, fixing bugs on the site as well as adding
        new features. Learned a lot at that internship, so I will be writing a blog
        post on my experience in the coming days.
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides the world of code, I listen to police scanners and tweet about
        crime/mayhem. You can find more about that on my Twitter feed, linked below.
      </p>

      <h2>Ambitions</h2>

      <p>
        I've got a lot of ambitions.
      </p>

      <p>
        For COM327 specifically, I'm eager to learn more about web standards and what
        the "proper" way of writing HTML/CSS/JS is, so I can apply that in my
        professional and personal work. Additionally, I have never done mobile-first
        design before, so I would like to go deeper into that. My primary reason for
        taking the class is to learn more on the design and standards side, as I
        already know the language syntax. Hopefully by the end of the semester my
        learning goals will be accomplished.
      </p>

      <p>
        More broadly, this fall and spring semester my ambition is to participate more
        in class - ask questions, have longer discussions. Often I feel like I am not
        fully absorbing the knowledge because I do not have a chance to apply it or
        discuss it, so I want to change that. Additionally, I seek to do some teaching
        of my own. Over the summer I gained the nickname of "The Professor" for
        actually teaching the more experienced team members a couple things. I want to
        continue this trend of spreading my knowledge through sharing my experience in
        classes as well as meeting with people one-on-one.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the next 3-5 years, my aspiration is to graduate IIT (hopefully in Spring
        2016), and move on to join a startup company involved in education or
        aviation. Perhaps even launching my own company out of college - I already am
        working on Plannr, a new way to do academic planning and course registration,
        so I want to continue working on this and expand the business to at least 5
        universities. This will take a great deal of work, especially for getting the
        initial university onboard with the software.
      </p>

      <p>
        From a very early age, I have been tinkering with systems (electronic and
        otherwise). Throughout my life, I want to make sure the work I do is
        meaningful. Meaningful not just for myself, but for others who may not be as
        well-off. My professional and personal goal/mission is to help make people
        more informed and knowledgeable. I have done this through technology thus far,
        and I am content with continuing this trend. However, I may want to expand my
        horizons to outside technology - you can only do so much with ones and zeroes.
        How far will this mission take me? I can't wait to find out.
