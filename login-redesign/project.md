## Redesigned Login/Sign-up Form (**Due Oct 31**)

      You will locate a crappy combination login/sign-up form somewhere on the web (don’t worry,
      they’re not hard to find). You will then create a usable, accessible and mobile-friendly
      redesign of the form.

### Goals

*   Consider the usability challenges inherent in web-based forms
*   Design for the needs of new and returning users
*   Increase your sophistication in writing HTML and CSS, particularly for form elements
*   Employ mobile-first, responsive design techniques
*   Design to a typographic scale
*   Design to a basic grid system

### Deliverables

*   An email sent to the instructor the week of October 6 with URLs to two possible forms that you might redesign
*   Written feedback on three other student’s projects, via email CC'd to instructor, before
        project due date
*   An email to the instructor containing:

        *   The https:// link to your project’s GitHub repository containing an HTML file, your CSS,
            JavaScript and any media elements (email URL to instructor by due date)
    *   A 1-2 paragraph self-critique (email to instructor by due date)

### Requirements

*   Valid, well-formed HTML5 and CSS
*   CSS3 transitions that enhance user experience, where appropriate
*   HTML5 form elements, where appropriate
*   JavaScript that does not throw any errors, if project uses JavaScript
*   HTML-based fallbacks for any media elements (image, audio, video) that you include
*   Thoughtful use of media-queries with breakpoints specified in em units
*   Organized, readable source that is hand-written and original (no WYSIWYGs or
        code-generators)
